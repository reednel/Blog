#### A Preface

The information in this post comes in great part from *A General Theory of Love*[^1]. This book plays a little fast and loose with certain psychological ideas, and in particular with the model of human brain structure. Of course,  brain structure is complicated and messy, so just about any time you label and define some region of the brain you’re doing a simplification. That said, it appears modern neuroscientists think that *for a simplification* this model is doing a decent job. And this may remain a good model for this theory of love, because most of what’s since been discredited are its evolutionary claims about the order of development.

## The Triune Brain Model

The **Triune Brain Model** divides the brain into 3 regions, based on distinctions in physical location and architecture, function, and (sort of) evolutionary age.

The **Reptilian brain** is the oldest part of the brain. This is responsible for autonomic and instinctive function, i.e. breathing, heart rate, circadian rhythm, and reflexes. If you’re brain dead but not dead dead, this is the region that’s still lit up.

The **Limbic brain** is the center for all things emotion, and is biologically unique to mammals. In the mext section we will focus on this region.

The **Neocortex** is the newest part of the brain. This is where our ability to reason and do higher level thinking come from, what makes humans so distinct from all other animals.

This physical and evolutionary distinction between the limbic and neocortical brain offer a partial explanation as to why emotionality and rationality are so often at odds. And contrary to what we (I) might like to think, thoughts have little power in affecting emotion...how often do you successfully talk yourself out of a feeling?

## Limbering Up

According to Lewis, Amini, and Lannon, love isn’t just a feeling, but a connection between brains. Our limbic brain connects us with other mammals, particularly humans in subtle, but incredibly influential ways.

**Limbic Resonance** is a process by which one can tune into another’s emotional state, and physiologically empathize. It affect us with varying degrees of subtlety. Consider **Mood Contagion**, for example. When you see some stranger laughing, it might brighten you up a little bit. And when your best friend or significant other is laughing, it can be hard not to laugh with them. The authors argue that this is part of what gives concerts and movie theaters a special feel. It’s not just the surround sound and the popcorn, it’s everyone in the same room sharing in an emotion together.

**Limbic Regulation** is the process of changing another’s physiology and vice versa. There are thousands of physiological parameters, (i.e. blood pressure, immune function, oxygen, sugar, hormone levels), and the finding is that many of these systems seem to be on an open loop.

In the 40s, research was conducted on sterile nurseries--institutions for orphaned and babies and children. Back then, these nurseries thought it’d be a pretty sick idea to minimize contact with and between children to minimize the spread of illness. The study found that children handled this way, despite having all their physical needs met, became withdrawn, weaker, and more sickly. At a time when the outside death rate from measles was 0.5%, the death rate for these children was 40%. The average death rate for all children in these institutions was 75%, and the more “sterile” the nursery, the higher the death rate.

>“Because loving is reciprocal physiologic influence, it entails a deeper and more literal connection than most realize. Limbic regulation affords lovers the ability to modulate each other’s emotions, neurophysiology, hormonal status, immune function, sleep rhythms, and stability. If one leaves on a trip, the other may suffer insomnia, a delayed menstrual cycle, a cold that would have been fought off in the fortified state of togetherness.”

**Limbic Revision** is the process of changing the structure of the limbic brain. This is the basis for psychotherapy.

>“In a relationship, one mind revises another; one heart changes its partner. This astounding legacy of our combined status as mammals and neural beings is limbic revision: the power to remodel the emotional parts of the people we love, as our Attractors activate certain limbic pathways, and the brain’s inexorable memory mechanism reinforces them. Who we are and who we become depends, in part, on whom we love.”
