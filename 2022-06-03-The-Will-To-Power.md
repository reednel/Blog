## Introduction

Friedrich Nietzsche was born 1844 in Prussia, and died 1900, at age 55. Father and younger brother died when he was a young boy...He was very serious as a kid, didn’t make many friends. Initially went to university to study philosophy and theology, realized theology sucks, then transferred schools and got Syphilis from a prostitute, which left him physically weak and in pain for the rest of his life, and would also be the cause of his descent into madness. He got super into the music of the famous german composer [Richard Wagner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner), who he eventually met and vibed with sometimes. Eventually Nietzsche’s philosophy would end their friendship. Became a professor at the University of Basel at age 24. Retired from that in his 30’s, lived off a small pension. Made a friend in a young Psychoanalyst called [Lou Andreas-Salomé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Andreas-Salom%C3%A9), who he eventually proposed to 3 times and kept getting rejected. She later had sort of an affair with [Sigmund Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud). A short time later in 1889 when he’s about 44, he had a breakdown in the street while watching a horse being whipped, and was diagnosed with paralytic dementia, which severely disabled him, so he was put in a mental hospital, where he stayed until his death a decade later.

His sister Elisabeth was a bit of a Nazi, and after his death, took his very unfinished draft of The Will to Power, wrote a bunch of nazi-ish things in there and had it published in his name. Later she sent it over to Hitler, who appreciated it, and this seems to be the main reason for the very mistaken association between Nietzsche and Nazism.

Nietzsche was kind of a gloomy character, but his philosophy is cheerful. Broadly speaking, he wants us to affirm this life rather than looking beyond to the next. A good life is a passionate one, embracing creativity, culture, self-discipline, and power.

Life is good when it strong, and bad when it is weak. Some people are better than others.

## Eternal Recurrence of the Same

What if there is no escape from this life? How would you receive this news? How would you live (differently)? Would your attitude change toward life?  This is the idea of **Eternal Recurrence of the Same**.

This idea is meant to undermine the sense that we’re getting somewhere and achieving something. There is no culmination to give our actions a point. Nietzsche introduces this idea for us to test weather we live in a healthy or unhealthy way. If this thought makes you uncomfortable, you’re living wrong. This is partially a test to see if you’re living well, but also a sort of guide on the day-to-day scale to indicate to you what you could do better.

## The Negative Account: God and Morality

### The Importance of God's Existence

God has a unified point of view over everything, and this creates order and stability. 
God’s point of view is the objective point of view, from which matters of fact arise (what to think)
God defines the standards of morality (how to act)
God and the afterlife provide us with meaning in this life (a reason to care about what god says)
[Use visual of point on graph]
Nietzsche believed that in his day, the ideas and influence of Christianity persisted, but were beginning to lose their hold on society. And nothing had emerged to take its place.

### The Origin of Morality

Let’s pick on religion, for now...consider this account of the origin of christianity:
What was initially given was a form of life occurring alongside other forms of life: a small group of people living out a modest existence in some dusty corner of the Roman Empire. These peoples practices subtly suggested a sense of what the world was about, but had no special significance to or validity to them or anybody. The religious belief system only begins to take shape when some figure comes along and bestows on them the sense that their way of life is of highest value. So basically Jesus came along and made this group feel noble and proud of their meekness and humility, this way of life which previously looked base and slavish. Over time this interpretation of the world is systematized, codified, and new generations are brought up on it as if it’s The Truth, and always has been.
On this account, there is nothing validating a moral system beyond the agreement of some people. And this is as true of science and secular moralities as it is of religion. In all cases, despite making universal claims, their basis is in individual perceptions of the world, and any added nuance over time is just added individual perception.

### The Problem with Morality

Christianity is detrimental to the strength of the will. Those who put their faith in God do so because they are weak, they seek someone to tell them what to think, how to act. They lack the strength to create their own meaning and exert their own will.
Nietzsche wants to say “shut up about your concern for what other people think about your moral behavior and what you think of theirs. focus instead on becoming someone who doesn’t need affirmation to know they’re right.” [Ties nicely into “become who you are”]

## The Positive Account: yes

### Nietzsche's *isms*

**Anti-essentialism** is the doctrine that there is no “reality” to things, no “fact of the matter” about thing’s intrinsic natures.

**Perspectivism** is the doctrine that there are only various finite, historically and culturally determined perspectives on what exists and that there is no God’s eye point of view from which one can survey what exists. That is, there is no getting to the bottom of “reality”. This is especially significant when it comes to something like science, which makes claims about reality and objectivity.

**Moral Particularism** is the idea that General moral principles cannot be applied to particular moral situations because each moral situation is different. Thus, sweeping moral judgements hold no value. Nietzsche considers it selfish or cowardly to hold others to your own moral judgements.

### The Will to Power

**The Will to Power** is a fundamental drive to overcome opposition, and this drive is at the core of all activity. Opposition both outside of us, in other people, and inside ourselves.The greatest way to test one’s strength is to seek out a worthy adversary. The essence of life which imbues the strong with the aim of extending its power even at great risk to itself. “But the essence of life as will to power is to seek its own glorious undoing, by pushing itself to, and beyond, its limits.” -Hank . A meta-drive which influences all of our particular drives, i.e. for knowledge, artistry, military exploits, sexual, social, or economic success, etc.

Contrary to the Darwinian idea that life is merely about survival, Nietzsche observes that in reality, this is rarely how organisms behave. An organism which is merely subsisting is one we take to be weak, perhaps sick—in any case, not how life should be. On the other hand, the organism which is strong, ever-growing, and ambitious is understood to be in good health, good at living. As we are all organisms, it follows that the best way to live, is to do so vigorously, to grow, expand our capabilities. This is the meaning of the positive will to power, it is “precisely the will of life”. Nietzsche thinks then, that basis for the will to power is much stronger than that of morality. It’s grounded in observable characteristics common to all living things.

Self-creation, and overcoming require different things from different people. Two people may act in total contradiction with the will of each other, and still be satisfying their individual wills to power. Rather than holding people to a certain set of actions, it holds them to a more abstract idea, which may be expressed through many different sets of actions.At first this seems like a strange thing to hear out of Nietzsche, a little while ago he was bitching out Christianity for its bad values, but there’s an important delineation to be made here. Power and values are on entirely different levels.

Nietzsche is not advocating a view like Aristotle on which you have some predetermined essence you have to realize. Rather, in a slightly [Sartrean](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sartre/) spirit, everything you do, your successes, failures, desires, hates...these all play a part in defining who you are. The self is a changing thing, wish is not just something you possess, but something you achieve through discipline and control and self-mastery. The will to power is primarily self-directed rather than directed towards others.

### The Artist; The Free Spirit; The Exemplary Individual

The life of the artist is filled with self-control, self-creation and interpretation, and active exploration and generativity. The artist is largely unbeholden to anyone, and when they are, they will still take control of their behavior and their work such that even a specifically requested piece of art serves as an expression of themself. These people are few and far between in Nietzsche’s eyes. On the contrary, most are weak, characterized by subservience, mediocrity, and dispassion.

### More on the Positive Account

Nietzsche really doesn’t want to tell us how to act specifically, but he does believe we should adhere to a certain lifestyle:

- Self-discipline in the service of Will to Power: foster drives which lead to achievement, and through this exercise of overcoming obstacles and expressing ourselves, we flourish and grow our power.
- Playing with values creatively: free spirits are free because they are not bound to any particular set of values or practices. Those are just different interpretations of existence, none of which are especially right or natural.

>“..we delight in all who, like us, love danger, war, adventure, who do not allow themselves to compromise, to be caught, placated, gelded...” (p. 168) and “Live at war with your fellows and yourselves!”

What is most important is satisfaction with oneself. If one is to hold themself together, a positive self-image is essential. Dissatisfaction with oneself is associated with a sick form of existence, in which one is weak and resents themselves and those better than them. This kind of person is the kind who lifts up religion, condemning those achievers.
