## Overview

Data compression is a process of modifying the representation of some information so that it can be stored using less data.

- Motivation: why do compression?

## Entropy - Formally Quantifying Information

## ?Applying Entropy?

## Huffman Coding

- Naive method of storing data: array of unicde chars
- Something super cool and super rare: Huffman's one-shot

Essential to compression is that language is not uniform. That is, "A" doesn't appear with the same frequence as "Z". "A" makes up about 8% of all letters we write (as english speakers), but "Z" makes up a mere 0.07%[^1].

[^0]: [Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon) is the father of [Information Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory), and an absolute legend. He wrote the book "A Mathematical Theory of Communication", which a math professor of mine described as "one of the most important books in science in the last century".
