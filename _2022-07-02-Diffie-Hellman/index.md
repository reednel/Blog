- What is the Diffie Hellman Key Exchange?
- what else will we talk about?

## Culture

- GCHQ making not one but two of the most significant discoveries in cryptography years before academics did publicly.
- The US government literally treating cryptographic schemes as "munitions" for decades. Everything cryptography (double check this) was under the purview of the NSA.
- Once apon a time (until the 90's) a few governments held all the cards to secure communication.
